* Bash Tutorial Examples

A common issue the new Bash programmers are facing is that they can barely find the *real-world* examples on most of the materials.

That's why I created the [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5FUdGPVuWdfTBBXHcsLQg][Stacks Add Up]] to teach people learn technology skills with more ease. And this is the place to put all the Bash examples mentioned in my videos.

Hope they can help you.

Happy scripting!
